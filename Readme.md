## Overview

### The challenge
Your challenge is to build out this NFT-Preview-Card and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

1. View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
2. See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

}
```
